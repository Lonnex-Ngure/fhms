## Overview

### Project Description

The Funeral Home Management System (FHMS) is a comprehensive digital solution designed to address the unique challenges faced by funeral homes in managing their operations, services, and client interactions. In an industry where compassion, efficiency, and attention to detail are paramount, traditional paper-based processes and disconnected systems often lead to inefficiencies, communication gaps, and administrative burden during an already sensitive time for clients.

FHMS aims to solve these critical challenges by:

1. **Streamlining Administrative Workflows**: Reducing the paperwork burden by digitizing document management, including death certificates, burial permits, and contractual agreements, allowing staff to focus more on client care and less on administrative tasks.

2. **Improving Client Experience**: Providing families with a transparent, accessible platform to arrange services, track progress, submit required information, and make paymentsâ€”all from the comfort of their homes during a difficult time.

3. **Enhancing Operational Efficiency**: Coordinating the complex logistics between different departments (morgue, transport, ceremony planning) through digital task management and real-time status updates.

4. **Ensuring Regulatory Compliance**: Maintaining proper documentation and audit trails to meet strict regulatory requirements in the funeral industry.

5. **Providing Data-Driven Insights**: Offering analytics and reporting tools to help funeral home management make informed decisions about service offerings, resource allocation, and financial planning.

The system serves as a bridge between the sensitive, human-focused nature of funeral services and the need for efficient, accurate business operations in modern funeral homes of all sizes.

### Role-Based Functionality

The Funeral Home Management System (FHMS) provides different user experiences and capabilities based on role:

- **Admin Users**: Complete system management including user management, service offerings, document review, and financial reports
- **Client Users**: Book services, upload and access documents, make payments, and communicate with funeral home staff
- **Morgue Attendants**: Manage deceased records, body preparation tasks, and transport logistics

The system automates workflows, enhances communication, and provides transparent service management for all stakeholders involved in the funeral process.

## Integration Between Frontend and Backend

The FHMS employs a modern client-server architecture:

1. **API Communication**: The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints using Axios HTTP client
2. **Authentication Flow**: 
   - Users authenticate via the login form
   - The backend validates credentials and issues a JWT token
   - Token is stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
   - Subsequent API requests include the token in Authorization header

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Frontend components make API calls to fetch or modify data
   - Backend validates requests and performs database operations
   - Responses are processed and rendered in the UI

4. **File Handling**:
   - Documents are uploaded via multipart/form-data requests
   - Backend stores files in the uploads directory and metadata in the database
   - Download links are generated for secure file access

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Backend returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
   - Frontend displays user-friendly error notifications using Sonner toast
   - Form validation occurs on both client and server sides

6. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Polling or webhook mechanisms for notification updates
   - Status changes reflect immediately in the UI
